Toms Dotfiles
=============

###About
Recently I've been discovering tiling window managers and that customizeing my desktop is really cool.
This means I've got a "lot" of dotfiles I want to share across my machines and with everyone who is interested.

###How to install

1. Clone this repository and cd into it
2. Run `./dotfiles.sh --sync` to sync all the dotfiles to your $HOME

Thanks to [jbernard](https://github.com/jbernard) for making dotfile management easy!
